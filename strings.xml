    <string name="personality_page_body">
        INTJs tend to be introverted and prefer to work alone.
        INTJs look at the big picture and like to focus on abstract information rather than concrete details.
        INTJs place greater emphasis on logic and objective information rather than subjective emotions.
        INTJs like their world to feel controlled and ordered so they prefer to make plans well in advance.
